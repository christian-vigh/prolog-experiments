******************
* Release 1.0RC1 *
******************
= initial version, based on the work of Elisheva Bonchek (le7bonch AT cs.huji.ac.il) and Sara Cohen (sarac AT ie.technion.ac.il, http://iew3.technion.ac.il/~sarac).

*switch to SWI-Prolog (freely available on http://www.swi-prolog.org/); SICSTUS-Prolog was not free software
*limitation to files with extension .pl, residing in same directory as PrologDoc itself, has been solved
*docs-directory automatically created if non-existing
*validated plain html, with possible use of a CSS-stylesheet, instead of the fixed layout
*synonymous predicates are differentiated on the index page and at the top of the other html-files by their form-values instead of the usual name/arity. Only if there are multiple files with the same predicate and arity, there will be synonyms. This could be solved in the future, but is not that relevant for the moment.
*PrologDoc looks for a style sheet (style.css) in the specified PrologDoc-directory.
*Default css-stylesheet by Kris De Schutter.
