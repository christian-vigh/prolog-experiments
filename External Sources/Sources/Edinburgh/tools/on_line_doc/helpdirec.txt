In general HELP files, whose names end in .HLP, are to be found in
the same subdirectory as the file they describe. *But* there are a
few .HLP files which do not describe a particular .PL file. These are
to be found in the special directory
	/usr/local/lib/prolog/toolkit/static/on_line_doc/helper_files
.HLP files can be found in the following directories:


/usr/local/lib/prolog/data/lists
