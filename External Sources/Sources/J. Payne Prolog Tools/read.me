 This is the contents of the edinburgh library tape.

 Unfortunately I had to flatten the directory structure as I copied it.
 All the files have been left as version 1 and should stay that way,
 modified versions should go elsewhere to preserve source integrity.

 It must be said that it is in a bit of a mess;  If you want to use 
 any of thi stuff you will need to do some source hacking.

 Useful things to read are:

 CONTENTS. - contains brief info on the files.
 *.HLP     - contains details of a program written by the author.
