   COMPUTER ALGEBRA IN PROLOG consists of four files:

   (READ.ME)           is the present file.

   ALGEBRA.TXT         is a short paper on computer algebra in Prolog.
                       The paper is self-contained and includes the
                       listings of the sample programs discussed, with
                       several examples of applications.
                       You can print it out on your Epson-compatible
                       printer (it is formatted by a word processor,
                       so if you browse through it on the screen you
                       will see some "funny" characters appear).

   DIFFSV.PRO          is a program in Prolog for the symbolic
                       differentiation of algebraic functions.

   SIMPSV.PRO          is a program in Prolog for the symbolic
                       simplification of algebraic functions.

   The two programs are described in the paper, which should be
   read before using them.

   The programs run under PD Prolog (ver.1.9), a public domain Prolog
   developed by Bob Morein of Automata Design Associates, 1570 Arran Way,
   Dresher, PA 19025, who may be contacted to obtain a copy of the program.

   To run the programs you must have the file PDPROLOG.EXE
   You then proceed as follows
      enter
                 pdprolog
      and at the prolog prompt '?-' first enter
                                                  consult(diffsv).
      and, at the following prompt,
                                                  consult(simpsv).

   At this point you are ready to run the examples discussed in the
   paper (or any other case involving algebraic functions).
   To get out of the PDPROLOG environment and come back to DOS,
   enter
          exitsys.
   after the prompt.


   The programs should also run with little or no modification under
   other Prolog interpreters or compilers following the Edimburgh
   syntax.


   COMPUTER ALGEBRA IN PROLOG is placed in the public domain, but
   the author retains the copyright of the paper and programs.

   You may copy and distribute COMPUTER ALGEBRA IN PROLOG provided
   that it is done free of charge, that all four files are copied
   without modifications and, in particular, the copyright notices
   are not removed or changed.

   I hope you will enjoy these programs.
