    *********************************************************
    *  The First PROLOG Contest and the Third LISP Contest  *
    *********************************************************

  sponsored by WGSYM of Information Processing Society of Japan

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of these Contests is to gather the timing
results of various PROLOG and LISP implementations.  We have no
intention to rank the implementations.  According to the timing
results, the implementor can judge the quality of his
implementations, and the user can select the most suitable
implementation to his application or optimize his programs.

BENCHMARKS: The benchmarks for PROLOG and LISP Contest consists
of 4245 and 4111 lines, respectively.  The benchmarks are
available from:

	Richard P. Gabriel (Stanford University, USA)
	Guy L. Steele, Jr. (Carnegie-Mellon University, USA)
	Henry Lieberman (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA)
	Jerome Chailloux (INRIA, France)
	Herbert Stoyan (University of Erlangen, FRG)
	Paul F. Wilk (University of Edinburgh, Scotland)
	Yasuhiro Kaneda (Cambridge University, England)
	Hiroshi G. Okuno (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public
			  Corporation, Japan)

PARTICIPATION OF CONTESTS: Any implementor or use of PROLOG or
LISP can participate these Contest.  The deadline of the Contests
is 28 February, 1985.  Please send us the timing results by the
deadline.  The computer-readable data is highly recommended and
the media will be returned with the full detailed record.

REPORT: The full detailed record will be published in English
next year.
