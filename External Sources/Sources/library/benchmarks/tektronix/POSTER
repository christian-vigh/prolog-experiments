Subject: A set of PROLOG benchmarks...

I received the following file late in the Summer, with permission
to post it to the net.  It's a set of Prolog benchmarks, by folks
at Tektronix and Portland State University.  The times included
are for C-Prolog on a Tektronix Magnolia-- as I understand it, a
predecessor of the 4404. 

I've run them-- with minor changes-- with Quintus Prolog, on a VAX
785 at MCNC, and with C-Prolog, UNSW Prolog and MU-Prolog at UNC
Chapel Hill, also on a 785. (Both running 4.2bsd UNIX.) For those
folks with other Prologs or other machines, I will volunteer to
collect the results you mail and post a summary to the net later
in the Fall.

I'd also like to hear comments on the benchmarks themselves.  For
that, a discussion on the net is more appropriate.

Cut along the dotted line, and enjoy!
