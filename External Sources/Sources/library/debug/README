Shapiro's Prolog Debugging System

   These are the files being sent below.   They use TOPS-20 file syntax.
All examples  run  on  Prolog-10  version  3.3  on  a DEC 2060, and some
modifications may be necessary to get them to run on other Prologs  [for
example when loaded into Quintus Prolog the code did not run].
