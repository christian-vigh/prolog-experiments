Here is  a Flat Concurrent Prolog Compiler to the digest, as well
as an introduction to FCP. We suggest that the introduction be published
and the files for the compiler be placed in the library. The files in this
message have been concatenated and are identified by "/**FILE : Name **/"
They are :

letter - this file
intro - introduction

lfcpc - load file
compile.pl        -  compiler
kernel.pl         -  for compiling body kernel predicates
runtime.pl        -  runtime routines
toplevel.pl       -  top level routines
trace.pl          -  trace package
unify.pl          -  unification
util.pl           -  utilities
