%   File   : GETFIL.PL
%   Author : Richard A. O'Keefe

%   Purpose: read a file name from the terminal

:- public
	getfile/1,
	read_a_line/2.

/*  This is for use in tools for analysing Prolog (or other) files.
    getfile(File) prompts Next file: and reads a file name without
    any extraneous punctuation.  The file name is returned as an
    atom.  System-dependent processing should be done here.  The
    current Dec-10 version does that wrongly.  If you have a "search
    list", e.g. something like the $PATH environment variable for
    UNIX programs, this is a good place to put it in.

    read_a_line is similar to the read_line predicate in read_sent,
    but (a) it prompts, and (b) most of the tools that load this
    file don't wany anything else from read_sent.  But if your
    system wants do do case conversion on file names, you'll find
    the predicate you want there.  Oh well.
