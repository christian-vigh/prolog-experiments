FEATURES:
    Interpreter, targetted at educational or research usage.
    The CLP(R) language is an instance of the Constraint Logic
    Programming scheme described in [Jaffar & Lassez 87].  Its
    operational mode is similar to that of Prolog.  A major
    difference is that unification is replaced by a more general
    mechanism: solving constraints in a domain of uninterpreted
    functors over real arithmetic. (from the programmer's manual)

CONTACT:
	 Dale Miller (dale@linc.cis.upenn.edu)
	 University of Pennsylvania
    or
	 Gopalan Nadathur (gopalan@cs.duke.edu)
	 Duke University
FEATURES:
    Lambda Prolog extends Prolog by
	 (1) using typed lambda-terms instead of first-order terms,
	 (2) permitting quantification over function and predicate variables
	 (3) performing higher-order unification and lambda-conversion
	 (4) permitting and interpreting universally quantified goals, and
	 (5) containing a notion of modules.
    This logic programming language provides many of the higher-order
    features which are common in functional programming languages.  The
    availability of higher-order unification, however, gives this
    language a certain kind of richness not present in other programming
    languages.  We illustrate this richness by demonstrating how this
    language can be used to provide novel specifications of
	 (1) theorem provers and proof systems,
	 (2) program transformation algorithms, and
	 (3) knowledge representation systems.

		features.
AVAILABILITY:	academic and commercial licenses
COST:		substantial educational discounts available.
STATUS:
    Development continuing. "Delivery" mechanism planned.  Being
    ported to other machines. Developed as part of software infra-
    structure for UK "Alvey Programme" in advanced IT.  Now
    marketed and supported internationally.
FEATURES:
    Mixed language development system, providing incremental
    compilers for DEC-10 Prolog, Common Lisp and POP-11 (like Lisp,
    but readable syntax, co-routines, etc.); routines written in C,
    Fortran and Ada may be linked dynamically into POPLOG
    environment and unlinked if necessary.  Integrated editor
    included. Window manager. Large number of online HELP, TEACH
    and Program library files.  Incremental compiler for Standard
    ML available optionally.  The languages all compile
    incrementally via a common virtual machine. So mixed language
    programming is supported, with shared data-structures.
    Tools provided for adding incremental compilers for new
    languages.  The Prolog is fast, but re-coding critical
    deterministic bits in POP-11 can achieve further speed-up.
    Object Oriented programming library included. Autoloading and
    search lists provide extreme tailorability, e.g. for teaching,
    or project libraries.

SRC/MACHINE/OS:	IBM-PC/XT/ATs or compatibles under DOS-2.1 or higher.
COST:		99.95 (US) + shipping/handling.
FEATURES:
    Constraint based logic prog. lang. It contains six different
    decision procedures. These include the full dec. proc. for the
    Presburger Arithmetic (arbitrarily quantified systems of linear
    equations and inequalities in integers). Trilogy also decides
    constraints involving finite mappings such as "a(x)=y" where all
    three variables can be solved for.  Because of the constraints
    Trilogy executes combinatorial problems involving arithmetic
    thousand times faster than Prologs.  Trilogy is fully based on
    the first order theory of S-exprs and it does not contain a single
    extralogical feature. Trilogy is an integrated language in that it
    contains 3G constructs (Pascal-like predicates and types) as well
    as 4G constructs (extensive dbase file operations).  Dbase files
    can be also queried in the 5G setting of predicate calls.  Trilogy
    comes with its own environment including online editor, native
    code compiler, linker, loader, and module librarian.

	 inter process communication facilities
	   * asynchronous processes may be started with streams to and
	     from the process optionally created
	   * A stream may be polled to see if it is ready to be read.
	   * In a BSD universe it is possible to do a select on a list
	     of streams. Select blocks for a given interval until one of
	     the supplied streams are ready. This stream is unified with
	     the last argument.
	 many bug fixes
	 a profiling facility that gives the user the ability to find out,
	 for each clause total calls, fails, exits, cputime, the number
	 of times each subgoal of the clause exits
