%   File   : NOT.PL
%   Author : R.A.O'Keefe
%   Updated: 17 November 1983
%   Purpose: "suspicious" negation 

/*  This file defines a version of 'not' which checks that there are
    no free variables in the goal it is given to "disprove".  Bound
    variables introduced by the existential quantifier ^ or set/bag
    dummy variables are accepted.  If any free variables are found, 
    a message is printed on the terminal and a break level entered.

    It is intended purely as a debugging aid, though it shouldn't slow
    interpreted code down much.  There are several other debugging
    aids that you might want to use as well, particularly
	unknown(_, trace)
    which will detect calls to undefined predicates (as opposed to
    predicates which have clauses that don't happen to match).

    The predicate free_variables/4 defined in this files is also used
    by the set_of/bag_of code.

    Note: in Dec-10 Prolog you should normally use "\+ Goal" instead
    of "not(Goal)".  In C-Prolog you can use either, and would have to
    do some surgery on pl/init to install this version of "not".  The
    reason that I have called this predicate "not" is so that people
    can choose whether to use the library predicate not/1 (in Invoca.Pl)
    or this debugging one, not because I like the name.
